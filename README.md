## State Management Choice

### Why GetX?

This project uses **GetX** for state management, chosen for the following reasons:

#### ‚úÖ **Simplicity & Productivity**
- **Minimal boilerplate**: GetX requires less code compared to other solutions
- **Easy to learn**: Simple syntax that's beginner-friendly
- **Fast development**: Quick implementation of reactive state management

#### ‚úÖ **Performance**
- **Lightweight**: Small package size with minimal overhead
- **Efficient rebuilds**: Only rebuilds widgets that actually need updates
- **Memory efficient**: Automatic disposal of controllers when not needed

#### ‚úÖ **All-in-One Solution**
- **State Management**: Reactive state with `.obs` and `GetBuilder`
- **Dependency Injection**: Built-in DI with `Get.put()` and `Get.find()`
- **Route Management**: Simple navigation with `Get.to()` and `Get.toNamed()`
- **Utils**: Snackbars, dialogs, and theme management

#### ‚úÖ **Code Examples in This Project**

**Reactive State:**
```dart
class CartController extends GetxController {
  final RxList<Product> items = <Product>[].obs;
  int get itemCount => items.length;
}
```

**UI Updates:**
```dart
GetBuilder<CartController>(
  builder: (cart) => Text('${cart.itemCount}'),
)
```

**Dependency Injection:**
```dart
Get.put<CartController>(CartController(), permanent: true);
final cart = Get.find<CartController>();
```

**Navigation:**
```dart
Get.toNamed(Routes.PRODUCT_DETAIL, arguments: product);
```

#### üîÑ **Alternative Considerations**

While GetX was chosen for this project, other viable options include:
- **Provider**: More explicit, better for large teams
- **Bloc**: Great for complex state logic and testing
- **Riverpod**: Modern, compile-safe alternative to Provider

GetX was selected for this e-commerce app because it provides a complete solution with minimal setup, making it perfect for rapid prototyping and small to medium-sized applications.

## API Integration

The app uses the [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/) for product data:

- **Endpoint**: `https://fakestoreapi.com/products`
- **Fallback**: Local sample data when offline
- **Caching**: Products cached locally for offline access

## Key Dependencies

- **get**: ^4.6.5 - State management, dependency injection, and routing
- **http**: ^1.5.0 - HTTP client for API calls
- **shared_preferences**: ^2.0.15 - Local storage for caching and theme persistence

## Features in Detail

### Product Catalog
- Grid layout with responsive design
- Search functionality with real-time filtering
- Product images with loading states and error handling
- Pull-to-refresh for data updates

### Shopping Cart
- Add/remove products with animations
- Real-time cart count and total calculation
- Persistent cart state across app sessions
- Clear cart functionality with confirmation

### Theme Management
- Light and dark theme support
- Theme persistence across app restarts
- Smooth theme transitions
- Material Design 3 color schemes

### Offline Support
- Cached product data for offline viewing
- Graceful error handling with user feedback
- Sample products as fallback data

## Testing

The app includes unit tests for:
- Controllers (ProductController, CartController, ThemeController)
- Use Cases (Cart operations)
- Business logic validation

Run tests with:
```bash
flutter test
```

## Performance Optimizations

- **Image Caching**: Network images cached with specified dimensions
- **Lazy Loading**: Products loaded efficiently with pagination support
- **Memory Management**: Proper disposal of controllers and streams
- **Build Optimization**: Const constructors and efficient rebuilds
